Ajax Framework for Java Web Applications

The objective of this project is to provide a pure Ajax enabeld web development framework for java applications, which should have following qualities:

- Easy to use
- Ajax enabled, and should use latest jQuery API
- Clear separation between front-end (webpages) and backend (business logic)

The original project was started back in 2007 which is hosted on SourceForge.net. The project source code has been ported to this repository under deprecated folder. It requires a complete revamp, as the older API is based on older javascript libraries and in-efficient client side code.
